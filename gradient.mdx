# Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).

## Gradient Descent Intuition

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm to find the minimum of a function. It is a first-order optimization algorithm. This means it only takes into account the first derivative when performing the updates on the parameters.
